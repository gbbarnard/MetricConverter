## Getting Started

"Welcome to metric converter! 

Please input your query. For example, 1 km = m. 

Enter 'exit' or '-1' to exit the program"

If a user input something that is not handled, you should print something to remind the user the valid input format, e.g.,

"Your input is not currently handled by this app, please input another query, for example, 1 kg = lb"
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
